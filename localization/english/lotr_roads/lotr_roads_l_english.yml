[eriador|E] has long been a land depopulated, and even in the greater days of our forefathers there wasn't much interest in the west after the fall of [eregion|E]. However, things are changing in the world around us. The [dunedain|E] of [arnor|E] are sturing, beginning to resettle their old fortresses. Our fellow dwarves in the [bluemountains|E] seem to be at the dawn of a new age of reclaimed glory. And tho much diminished the [elves|E] still could be made great friends and trade partners such as in ages past.

To rekindle this trade and friendship with the east, to rejoin ourselves with our kin in the Iron Hills and [ereborrealmshort|E], and maybe even gain some amount of friendship with the [elves|E], we must create this road. The eastward half of the project connects [khazaddum|E] to the Old Forest Road, going through the land of [lothlorien|E] and the [anduinvale|E].

These great homes of the [dwarves|E] have long been abandoned, with their many halls sitting dark.
